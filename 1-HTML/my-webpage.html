			<h1>Hello World!</h1>
			
			<h2>A few fact about the world we live in</h2>
			
			<img src="earth.png" width="400">
			
			<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
			About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is 
			covered with water, mostly by oceans but also by lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which 
			together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's 
			outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over 
			many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid 
			outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.</p>
